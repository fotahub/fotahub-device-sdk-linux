# FotaHub&reg; Embedded Device SDK for Linux&reg; and Raspberry Pi
The FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for Linux&reg; and Raspberry Pi enables developers to create firmware for Linxu&reg; or Raspberry Pi-based IoT devices that can be updated through [FotaHub](http://fotahub.com). It provides an C99-based FotaHub client library along with a set of examples illustrating how the latter can be used and integrated in real applications.

# Supported targets

The FotaHub速 Device SDK for Linux速 and Raspberry Pi can be used on:
* Single board computers like Raspberry Pi and others
* Linux-based edge IoT devices
* Linux desktop computers (for testing and evaluation purposes)

> &#x1F6C8; You can test/evaluate the FotaHub速 Device SDK for Linux速 and Raspberry Pi even on a Windows&reg; or Mac&reg; OS X machine by using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

# Installation
To use the FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for Linux&reg; and Raspberry Pi, the following tools must be available on your laptop or computer:
* A GCC compiler/linker toolchain
* A [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads) interpreter
* A text editor or IDE of your choice, e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

# Getting started
The best way to get started with the FotaHub&reg; Device SDK for Linux&reg; and Raspberry Pi is to try out and study the included examples:
* [Simple](docs/getting-started/simple.md) - "Hello World" of firmware over-the-air updating with FotaHub&reg;
* [Rollbackable](docs/getting-started/rollbackable.md) - Downloads and launches a new firmware version provided at FotaHub&reg;, rolls it back to the previous version if something goes wrong
* [Thing Shadow](docs/getting-started/thingshadow.md) - A real-world scenario where FotaHub&reg; is used in combination with the AWS IoT Thing Shadow service to trigger firmware updates over-the-air updates through the cloud
